What are “Traditions”? Things we have been following just because our ancestors told us? Traditions are the things which bind us with each other, reminds us of what we were. To nourish  intradepartmental bonding, the AEA council successfully arranged  “Aerospace Department Traditional Day” on 13th October 2018. This informal event was really helpful to enhance Senior-junior interaction. The photoshoot and the screening of the movie “October Sky” were the main attractions of the day.
